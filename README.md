# Convert HepMC ASCII files to DOT graphs

The `hepmc2dot.py` scripts converts ASCII files generated by `HepMC::IO_GenEvent` to the common DOT graph format. It is tested only for Python 2.7 at this point.

HepMC is a High Energy Physics package for storing Monte Carlo event records. These records can typically be represented in a tree structure, where particles are edges and interaction vertices are nodes.

The official HepMC documentation is at:

# Usage

Convert HepMC ASCII file `hepmcfile.txt` to DOT graph and store there result in `dotfile.dot`:
```shell
hepmc2dot.py hepmcfile.txt dotfile.dot
```
